# HelloðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github! :rocket:

I am a recent graduate of a 12-week, fully virtual, Web Development bootcamp though UCSD extension. :mortar_board: All instruction and materials were provided through Zoom, GitHub, GitLab, Google Drive, and Slack due to the COVID-19 crisis.

The bootcamp covered the fundementals of coding, including Git, HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap & Materialize), Javascript, Web-API's, Third-Party API's, Server-Side API's, Node Js, MySQL, Express, Mongo DB, mongoose, and REACT. :computer:

I have experience working independently on building my version of a website, as well as, working in a group on complex projects throughout the entire development lifecycle. In past roles, I have been praised for my can-do attitude, creativity and problem solving skills. :thought_balloon:

With a strong background in Customer Service and a passion for learning, I am motivated to launch a STEM career by continuing to create and collaborate on dynamic web applications. :octocat:
